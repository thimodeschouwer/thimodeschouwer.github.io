## About Me

I am a PhD student at the [Economics Department](https://feb.kuleuven.be/research/economics/ces) of Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, funded by the [Research Foundation - Flanders](https://www.fwo.be/en/). My research is in labor and family economics. I'm interested in how individuals and firms value all kinds of job attributes, how this affects equilibrium labor market outcomes, and what this implies for inequality. To study these questions, I use a broad range of empirical and structural methods.

Currently, I am visiting the Instutute for Applied Microeconomics at the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/university/university).
